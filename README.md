# Multithreaded Producer–Consumer System (Linux, C)

This project implements a classic producer–consumer system using POSIX threads,
mutexes, and condition variables.

The goal is to explore concurrency, synchronisation, and blocking semantics in
Linux user space, and to relate these concepts to RTOS-based embedded systems.
